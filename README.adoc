== About

This library provides a high performance thread pool that shares blocking, monitoring, and busy waiting threads.
Busy waiting tasks have `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `DAEMON` (low) priority, or `TIMER` (fixed rate events) status. All tasks run on a single thread without creating garbage.

See `net.openhft.chronicle.core.threads.EventLoop` and `net.openhft.chronicle.threads.EventGroup`.

== Event Loops and Event Handlers
An event handler is a routine action that should be executed in response to an event. Therefore,
event handlers should be invoked frequently to check whether a specific event has happened, and
subsequently the event handler can execute the relevant action in response to the event. In order
to trigger frequent invocation of event handlers, an event loop is instantiated and event handlers
are added to the event loop. Each event loop can serve multiple event handlers. Figure 1
illustrates a diagram of an event loop that serves several event handlers sequentially.

.Event Loop and Event Handlers

You can create and remove event loops and event handlers and add event handlers to event loops
as described below:

* *Creating event handler:* An event handler can be created by implementing the `EventHandler` interface and
overriding its `action()` method so that it executes some actions in response to the event that
this event handler is responding to. The `action()` method returns a boolean value. If the `action()`
method returns true, the event loop is biased to serve the same handler again soon. How soon
depends on a variety of factors, and the other work the event loop has to do across the other
event handlers. Returning "true" when there is no actual work to do may waste cycles servicing a handler which has nothing to do, at the
expense of stealing cycles away from other handlers. Conversely, returning "false" when there is work to do, will
effectively increase latency as the event loop will take the "false" as a hint that several other handlers can be
serviced ahead of this one.

[source,java]
----
//Create an event handler class that is ran for 30 times then throws
//InvalidEventHandlerException in order to remove the handler from event loop
public final class TestMediumEventHandler implements EventHandler {

        private int actionCnt;

        @Override
        public boolean action() throws InvalidEventHandlerException {
            if (actionCnt >= 30)
                throw InvalidEventHandlerException.reusable();
            actionCnt++;
            return true;
        }
}

//Instantiate event handler eh0
final TestMediumEventHandler eh0 = new TestMediumEventHandler();
----
* *Creating event loop:*  You can create an event loop by calling the constructor of the class
`VanillaEventLoop`. Then by calling the `addHandler()` method of this event loop you can add event handlers to
the event loop.

[source,java]
----
//Create event loop el
final VanillaEventLoop el = new VanillaEventLoop(null,
                                                 "test-event-loop",
                                                 PauserMode.busy.get(),
                                                 20,
                                                 false,
                                                 "none",
                                                 EnumSet.of(HandlerPriority.MEDIUM));
----
The arguments of `VanillaEventLoop` in the order of appearance are:

- final EventLoop parent: The parent event loop if this event loop is in an event group, otherwise "null".
- final String name: The name of this thread.
- final Pauser pauser: The pausing strategy of this event loop. See link:#_pauser[Pauser].
- final long timerIntervalMS: The pause duration.
- final boolean daemon: "true" if this is a daemon thread.
- final String binding: Set affinity description, "any", "none", "1", "last-1".
- final Set<HandlerPriority> priorities): The set of priorities that this event loop accepts for event handlers that
                                          are added to this event loop. See available priorities in link:https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Core/blob/ea/src/main/java/net/openhft/chronicle/core/threads/HandlerPriority.java[`HandlerPriority.java`].

Methods `start()` and `stop()`, starts and stops event loops respectively. Event handlers are
not executed before starting the event loop even if they have already been added to an event loop.
[source,java]
----
//Start event loop el.
el.start();
----

* *Adding an event handler to an event loop:* By calling `addHandler()` method of an event loop you can add an event
handler to an event loop.

[source,java]
----
//Add event handler eh0 to event loop el
el.addHandler(eh0);
----

* *Removing an event handler from an eventLoop:* When an event handler is not required anymore and should be removed
from the event loop, its `action()` method should throw `InvalidEventHandlerException`. The
`InvalidEventHandlerException.reusable()` method returns a reusable, pre-created, `InvalidEventHandlerException` that is
unmodifiable and contains no stack trace.

* *Closing event loop:* Calling the method `close()` shuts down an event loop. The method `close()` first
calls the method `stop()`. The method `stop()` notifies event loop to stop executing handlers however, this might not happen
immediately. It is not expected that event loops can then be restarted.

[source,java]
----
//Remove event loop el
el.close();
----

== Monitoring the Event Loop

The `MonitorEventLoop` thread monitors application threads to make sure event loop latency remains within acceptable bounds. The thread monitors latency by measuring the time the `action` method of the application event handlers takes to run. Whenever the method runs beyond an acceptable latency limit, `MonitorEventLoop` prints a stack trace.

Set the monitor event interval with system property `MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS` from the `EventGroup` class:

[source,java]
----
private static final long MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS = Long.getLong("MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS", 100);
----

Disable the monitor by setting the system property:

[source,java]
----
disableLoopBlockMonitor=true
----

Use any stack trace information to improve the design for efficiency.

=== Recommendations:

- Impose an interval of 100ms for every event loop.
- Consider adding `Jvm.safepoint` calls to help identify hotspots in the code.

=== Event Loop Action Handlers

Each event loop services multiple event handlers. The aggressiveness with which any one handler is serviced is influenced by the handler's priority as well as other activity on the event loop as a whole. If an event handler returns true from action() it biases the event loop to service the same handler again "soon". How soon depends on a variety of factors and the other work the event loop has to do across the other handlers.

Returning true when there is no actual work to do may waste cycles servicing a handler which has nothing to do, at the expense of stealing cycles away from other handlers. Conversely, returning false when there is work to do will effectively increase latency as the event loop will take the "false" as a hint that several other handlers can be serviced ahead of this one.

As a rule of thumb, an action handler should do a certain amount of work then yield/return. If it knows for sure that there is remaining work to be done at the point of yielding then return true. Otherwise return false and the event loop will revisit based on the handler's priority and other work load. As with a lot of scheduling approaches there's no single answer and some experimentation under typical loads would always be recommended. But the above rule of thumb is a good starting point.

== Pauser

`Pausers` specify the strategy to pause the current thread. Chronicle Threads provides a number of implementations of the `net.openhft.chronicle.threads.Pauser` interface.

The recommended way to use `Pauser`:

[source,java]
----
    while (running) {
        // pollForWork returns true if it does something, false if it does nothing
        if (pollForWork())
            pauser.reset();
        else
            pauser.pause();
    }
----

The various implementations of `Pauser` allow for varied pausing strategies - see the
http://openhft.github.io/Chronicle-Threads/apidocs/index.html[javadoc].

=== `Pauser` Modes

The available `Pauser` modes are summarised in below table.

.Alternative `pauser` modes
[cols="1,7,6,6,1,1"]
|===
| Mode | Description | Benefits | Downside | Can be monitored | Supports CPU isolation
| `busy` | Does not pause the event loop; performs busy-looping | Minimises jitter | Uses more CPU, no monitoring support | &#9746; | &#9745;
| `timedBusy` | Performs similar to busy `pauser` but for a specified time | Minimises jitter | Uses more CPU, slight overhead for monitoring | &#9745; | &#9745;
| `yielding` | Very briefly busy-loops then yields | Low jitter, can be shared | Uses more CPU | &#9745; | &#9746;
| `balanced` | Performs busy-looping for short periods and then backs off when idle for longer periods | Good balance of busy waiting and back off | Uses less CPU, but more jitter | &#9745; | &#9746;
| `milli` | Sleeps for one millisecond when backing off | Regular checks every 1 ms | Uses minimal CPU, but 1 ms jitter | &#9745; | &#9746;
| `sleepy` | Backs off when idle | Minimal CPU, like balanced but less CPU | More millisecond jitter | &#9745; | &#9746;
|===

The `busy` mode minimises jitter for best performance. However, it does maximise CPU usage and CPUs will run hotter. If there are too many threads in `busy` mode, a machine may slow down.

=== `Pauser` Mode Parameters

Each `pauser` mode has the following parameters:

* @param minBusy - the min number of times it will go around doing nothing, after this has been reached it will yield
* @param minCount - the number of times it will yield, before it starts to sleep
* @param minTime - the amount of time to sleep (initially)
* @param maxTime - the amount of time subsequently to sleep
* @param timeUnit - the unit of the minTime and maxTime

To demonstrate how a `pauser` would perform over time, below are the parameters for `sleepy` mode:

----
static TimingPauser sleepy() {
return new LongPauser(0, 100, 100, 20_000, TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS);
}
----

As such, this `pauser` would:

* spin for 0 times (minBusy)
* between 0-100 it will then yield (minCount)
* above 100, it would pause for 100 (minTime)
* it would subsequently pause for 20_000 (maxTime)
* the minTime and maxTime are in MICROSECONDS (timeUnit)

=== `TimingPauser`

`TimingPauser` interface extends the `Pauser` interface and pauses the current thread similarly, but it keeps track of accumulated pause times and throws a `TimeoutException` if the specified timeout is exceeded.
`sleepy`, `timedBusy` and `balanced` are of type `TimingPauser`.

=== `LongPauser`

`LongPauser` implements `Pauser` and `TimingPauser` and has the signature indicated below.

[source,java]
----
public LongPauser(int minBusy, int minCount, long minTime, long maxTime, @NotNull TimeUnit timeUnit)
----

`LongPauser` first busy-loops and if it is idle for at least `minBusy` times, then it yields for `minCount` times before it sleeps, then it initially sleeps for `minTime` and if still idle it sleeps for longer periods of `maxTime`.

=== Example

In a simple example which is reading from and writing to a socket, the handler typically
returns `true` if anything was read or written on the assumption it may need to read/write
something very soon. However, if nothing is read or written, it may still be called soon
however this is where the `Pauser` mode determines how the event loop will start backing off
when no work is being done.
